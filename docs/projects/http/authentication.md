# Authentication and abuse controls

Choose `RPT_AUTH__BACKEND=file` or `grpc`. Local-file mode requires a CSV with an
explicit `node_id,password` header. A numeric ID may appear only once. Rows and
passwords are validated at startup; restart to reload. Passwords are 1–79 printable
ASCII characters without whitespace. Use system-generated base64url credentials
for AllStarLink configuration compatibility. `examples/credentials.csv` is illustrative;
mount a real file at `/run/secrets/credentials.csv` readable by UID 10001.

For gRPC configure `RPT_AUTH__BACKEND=grpc`, `RPT_GRPC__TARGET`, and a service token
(`RPT_GRPC__TOKEN`) or both `RPT_GRPC__CLIENT_CERT` and `RPT_GRPC__CLIENT_KEY`.
`RPT_GRPC__CA` selects a custom CA; otherwise system roots are used. Server hostname
verification stays enabled. Development-only insecure transport requires both
`RPT_ENVIRONMENT=development` and `RPT_GRPC__INSECURE=true`. The [Central Auth service](../central-auth/index.md) authenticates registrar identities
and authorizes the scope of each lookup; TLS alone does not grant lookup permission.

Successful credential lookups use a thread-safe per-process LRU cache, default 4096
entries and 60-second TTL (`AUTH.CACHE_SIZE`, `AUTH.CACHE_TTL`). Unexpired credentials
remain usable during outages; misses and expired entries fail closed. No negative
or authentication-success caching, stale extension, or provider fallback. Invalid
proofs do not evict credentials or force lookups. Every password or challenge response
is verified. Rotation/revocation takes effect within the cache TTL. Fixed lock stripes
deduplicate simultaneous lookups; wait times and RPC calls are bounded. Default RPC
deadline is 2 seconds and lookup concurrency is 16 per process. Credentials and raw
authentication packets/bodies are never logged by this service.

`RPT_LIMITS__...` configures bounded per-process token buckets:

| Setting | Sustained rate/minute | Burst |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| GLOBAL_RATE / GLOBAL_BURST | 60000 | 2000 |
| SOURCE_RATE / SOURCE_BURST | 600 | 120 |
| FAIL_IP_RATE / FAIL_IP_BURST | 30 | 30 |
| FAIL_PAIR_RATE / FAIL_PAIR_BURST | 5 | 5 |
| REFRESH_RATE / REFRESH_BURST | 6 | 3 |

These are initial operational defaults, not universal capacity guarantees. Sources
behind shared NAT need appropriate burst capacity. Failure budgets are distinct
from successful refresh budgets. A malicious source cannot trigger a global node
lockout. Limits and cached state are capped at 16384 keys; new keys are denied when
capacity is exhausted. IAX workers default to 32 and admit traffic before allocating threads. HTTP uses
Gunicorn with one worker and 32 threads by default. IAX challenge state defaults
to 4096 transactions with a 30-second verification window. Malformed input is rejected before credential lookup. Failures are generic.
Internal counters track accepted/failed/throttled events without secret values.

All limits and caches are per process. Multiple Gunicorn workers or replicas multiply
those budgets. Put shared limits at the ingress/firewall for deployment-wide control
and monitoring, especially for distributed attacks and spoofed UDP. No Redis dependency
is introduced here. Plain file credentials and gRPC-retrieved credentials remain
sensitive in memory and must not be exposed in debug dumps or observability payloads.

Application authentication and publisher implementations are intentionally local to
each registrar. Identical provider/configuration/control modules are covered by the
same contract tests; the shared protobuf library remains schema-only. Database and
dummy authentication backends were removed; future database providers can implement
the same `get(node_id)` interface.
